# oneFileAIScripts

A collection of toy rpoject made of a single file scripts to discove the capability of AI (mostly OpenAI) tools
The project are my experiments or tutorial I've found online (credited).

## Requirements

Most of the script uses OpenAI as AI platform.
In order to run the scripts you need an OpenAI API Key.

All the scripts are written in python. To manage the dependency and use a virtualenv I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) so that's what you will find in all Setup sections.
THe list of dipendencies can be found in the respective **pyproject.toml** files.

## Setup

General setup, go to one of the toy projects directory and run:

```
poetry shell
poetry install
```

## Run the scripts

From inside the toy project directory, run:

```
python main.py
```

If other action are required you can find the informations in the README.md file of each toy project
