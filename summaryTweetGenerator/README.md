This script take a json file containig Title, COntent and a URL and generate a Tweet ready to be published

# Bonus

As a bonus feature I cheated on the one file policy and you can find a second script calle arxiv_tweet.py that use the arxiv (Scientific papaer archive) API to get the last published paper on a specific topic and generate a tweet out of it.

This version comes from the idea of Yeyu Huang that I found (here)[https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-twitter-bot-for-arxiv-paper-summarization-by-openai-and-langchain-in-10-minutes-e57de6b32e03]

## Run

As an addition to the standard way to run the script, the text that need to be analysed needs to be placed in the file called **source_file.json** without any special formatting.
